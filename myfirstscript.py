#problem 1 
#what is the missing in the while loop?
#use a breakpoint in line 6 to debug 
x = 1
while x < 10: 
    print(x) 
    x+=1

#the missing part is x+=1 at the end of while loop so that it is not infinite loop 

#problem 2 
mylist = list(range(5))

for x in range (1,5):
    print(f"Run No. :{mylist[x]}")

#change 6 in range 1,6 to 5
